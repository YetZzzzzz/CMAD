Figure1 Overview of the proposed CMAD framework. It consists of a student model, a teacher model, and two key modules: Correlation-Aware Feature Distillation (CAFD) and Modalities-Aware Regularization (MAR). CAFD ensures feature matching between student-teacher pairs and correlation alignment across samples between student-teacher and teacher-teacher representations, while MAR dynamically adjusts the weight of each modality combinations based on its difficulty.
